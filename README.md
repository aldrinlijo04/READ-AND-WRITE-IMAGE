# READ AND WRITE AN IMAGE
## AIM
To write a python program using OpenCV to do the following image manipulations.
i) Read, display, and write an image.
ii) Access the rows and columns in an image.
iii) Cut and paste a small portion of the image.

## Software Required:
Anaconda - Python 3.7
## Algorithm:
### Step 1:
          - Initialize the process by selecting an image and assigning it a meaningful filename, preferably in a format like "filename.jpg".

### Step 2:
          -Utilize the imread function from the OpenCV library, passing the chosen filename and appropriate flags to read the image data. Store this image data in a variable.

### Step 3:
          - Display the read image using the imshow function, providing a relevant window name and the image data obtained from the previous step. This action will create a graphical user interface window showing the image.

### Step 4:
          - If required, perform any necessary operations or modifications on the image data at this stage.

### Step 5:
          - For archival or processing purposes, use the imwrite function from OpenCV to save the modified image. Provide a filename and the modified image data to this function.

### Step 6:
Conclude the program execution gracefully. This involves closing any open graphical user interface windows displaying images, and freeing up system resources as needed.

## Program:

### Developed By:
### Register Number: 
i) #To Read,display the image
```
  

```
ii) #To write the image
```



```
iii) #Find the shape of the Image
```python3



```
iv) #To access rows and columns

```python3



```
v) #To cut and paste portion of image
```python3



```

## Output:

### i) Read and display the image

<br>
<br>

### ii)Write the image

<br>
<br>

### iii)Shape of the Image

<br>
<br>

### iv)Access rows and columns
<br>
<br>

### v)Cut and paste portion of image
<br>
<br>

## Result:
Thus the images are read, displayed, and written successfully using the python program.
